              </h2>
              <p className="font-v2-body text-sm leading-relaxed text-v2-on-surface-variant">
                Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot
                be excluded or limited under applicable law, including liability
                for death or personal injury caused by negligence or fraud.
                Subject to that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are
                not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
                or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill.
                Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to
                the Service is limited to the greater of £100 or the amounts you
                paid us for the Service in the twelve months before the claim
                (if any).

                On termination, your right to use the Service ceases; provisions
                that by their nature should survive (including intellectual
                property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and indemnity)
